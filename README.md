### Hi I'm Dustin 👋

**ducto489/ducto489** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a high school student in a small city. I love reading, love Physics, love coding.

- 🏫 I teach basic C/C++ to students wanting to experience code for their college major.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [Python game using pygame](https://github.com/longne123456/FirstGame).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analyst on MOOC.

Reaching me via email: `dustnn00@gmail.com `. I'm always up for interesting conversations and collaborations.
