### Hi I'm Dustin 👋

I'm a high school student. I love reading, love Physics, love coding.

- 🏫 I teach basic C/C++ to students wanting to experience code for their college major.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Python game using pygame.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analyst on MOOC.
- 😅 Fun fact: I have learned the [course CS50](https://github.com/ducto489/self-taught-CS50) about C, Python, SQL but don't get a certificate.

I'm best reached via email: `dustnn00@gmail.com`. I'm always up for interesting conversations and collaborations.
